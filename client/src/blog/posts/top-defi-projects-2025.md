**Top Defi Projects To Focus On In 2025**

Since the launch of Ethereum in 2015, decentralized finance (DeFi) has steadily gained traction, offering a range of financial services that operate without the need for traditional intermediaries like banks or financial institutions. This new way of accessing financial products has grown rapidly, especially in the last few years, fueled by the demand for greater transparency, lower fees, and more control over assets. 

The early days of DeFi were marked by the rise of decentralized exchanges like Uniswap, which made trading tokens without relying on centralized entities a reality. MakerDAO introduced the first widely-used decentralized stablecoin, DAI, and platforms like Aave and Compound brought decentralized lending and borrowing to the forefront. These projects demonstrated the potential of blockchain technology to reshape how financial systems operate, making them more inclusive and accessible.

However, as the DeFi space matured, it became clear that new challenges needed to be addressed. Issues like liquidity, scalability, and risk management were holding back wider adoption. To address these challenges, many projects have emerged with more specialized solutions—each targeting specific gaps in the market. For example to improve capital efficiency by better matching borrowers and lenders, enhancing trading experiences with higher speed and liquidity and base asset dependency.

As we look ahead to 2025, these projects represent the continued evolution of DeFi, offering new tools and infrastructure that improve the efficiency, scalability, and security of decentralized financial systems.
This article will explore six key DeFi projects for 2025—Hyperliquid, Morpho, Cork Protocol, Ethena, Gearbox, and Pendle—and discuss how each of these projects is tackling existing problems and bringing new capabilities to the ecosystem.

**Hyperliquid: A Decentralized Perpetual Exchange**

[Hyperliquid](https://hyperliquid.xyz/) is a decentralized perpetual exchange designed to optimize key aspects of trading, speed, liquidity, and pricing. It operates as a Layer 1 (L1) solution, which gives it an advantage in terms of speed and low latency, compared to Layer 2 platforms or centralized exchanges. This design ensures that users can execute trades quickly and with minimal slippage. 

The exchange aims to provide a fully on-chain, open financial system where user-built applications can interact directly with performant native components. This goal is pursued without sacrificing user experience, allowing for a more efficient trading environment in decentralized markets. Hyperliquid does not rely on external funding, being self-funded, which provides the development team with the flexibility to focus on building the product without the pressure of external capital. 

With over 330,000 users and $740 billion in all-time trading volume, Hyperliquid has demonstrated strong adoption in the decentralized exchange space. Its user base continues to grow, with the platform establishing itself as a significant player in DeFi, offering a trading experience optimized for performance and liquidity. 

**Morpho: Enhancing Capital Efficiency in Decentralized Lending**

[Morpho](https://morpho.org/) is a decentralized lending protocol that aims to enhance capital efficiency and optimize lending processes in DeFi. The platform operates through two main components: Morpho Optimizers, which aggregate liquidity, and the core Morpho protocol, which connects borrowers and lenders. By aggregating liquidity, Morpho helps users access more competitive interest rates and increases capital efficiency. 

The Morpho protocol's decentralized governance is managed through the MORPHO token, which allows participants to influence the platform's future direction. This approach is designed to create a more efficient lending market by optimizing the allocation of capital, reducing inefficiencies, and ensuring that both borrowers and lenders receive optimal terms. 

Currently, Morpho has a Total Value Locked (TVL) of $3.9 billion, with $2.3 billion borrowed on the platform. These figures indicate significant engagement with the platform, and the project has attracted attention from key investors, raising $50 million in a strategic round led by Ribbit Capital, along with participation from investors such as a16z crypto and Coinbase Ventures. 

**Cork Protocol: Risk Management for Pegged Assets in DeFi**

[Cork Protocol](https://corkprotocol.com/) is a protocol designed to address the risks associated with pegged assets, such as stablecoins and liquid staking tokens, which aim to maintain a 1:1 value with base assets like USD or Ether. The risk these assets face is that they can depeg during market stress or liquidity disruptions, potentially leading to financial losses. 

The core innovation of Cork Protocol is its "Depeg Swap," which allows market participants to hedge or trade their exposure to the risk of pegged assets losing their peg. By enabling the pricing of depeg risk, Cork Protocol introduces a risk management mechanism that is expected to increase the efficiency of the decentralized finance ecosystem. This approach allows users to better manage the inherent volatility and liquidity risks that can affect pegged assets. 

Cork's focus on risk pricing positions it as a foundational infrastructure project for DeFi, particularly in regard to on-chain credit markets. As the DeFi sector matures and capital inflows increase, effective risk management tools like Cork Protocol could become essential to maintaining stability.

The project is backed by A16Z crypto, one of the largest venture capital firms with a focus on crypto and DeFi sectors. 

**Ethena: A Synthetic Dollar Protocol for Crypto Markets**

[Ethena](https://www.ethena.fi/) is a synthetic dollar protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain, offering a decentralized alternative to fiat-backed stablecoins. The protocol's synthetic dollar, USDe, is not backed by fiat but instead by crypto assets like Ethereum and Bitcoin, along with corresponding short futures positions. This approach aims to provide stability without the reliance on centralized fiat-backed reserves. 

The stability of USDe is maintained through a process called delta hedging, where derivatives positions are used to ensure the synthetic dollar's value remains relatively stable in relation to its collateral. This method differentiates Ethena from traditional stablecoins and offers an innovative approach to managing synthetic assets in the DeFi ecosystem. 

Ethena also introduces the concept of the "Internet Bond," a yield-bearing instrument that combines revenue from staked assets (such as staked Ethereum) with funds from perpetual and futures markets. This bond offers a new way for users to earn rewards in the DeFi space while maintaining exposure to the underlying crypto market. 

Currently, Ethena has a TVL of $5.8 billion and is backed by several institutional investors, including Binance Labs, OKX Ventures, and Fidelity. Its design as a crypto-native stablecoin provides an alternative to traditional stablecoins and positions Ethena as a noteworthy project in the decentralized finance sector. 

**Gearbox: Composable Leverage in DeFi**

[Gearbox Protocol](https://gearbox.fi/) enables users to access leverage in decentralized finance, providing a way to borrow up to 10x leverage for trading, liquidity farming, and other DeFi strategies. The protocol allows for composable leverage, meaning that users can borrow capital and leverage their positions across various DeFi platforms, including Uniswap, Curve, and Lido, among others. 

The Gearbox platform operates in two parts: passive lenders and active borrowers. Passive lenders supply liquidity to the protocol and earn yields, while active borrowers can use leverage to increase their positions in DeFi activities. Gearbox's credit account abstraction simplifies the borrowing process, making it easier for users to manage collateral and access leverage without requiring advanced knowledge of the underlying infrastructure.

By bringing together lending and prime brokerage services in a single protocol, Gearbox enables users to implement more advanced strategies in the DeFi ecosystem. The platform is supported by Polymorphic Capital, 1inch, Lido, and Yearn Finance. 

**Pendle: Tokenizing Yield for DeFi Innovation**

[Pendle Finance](https://www.pendle.finance/) offers a novel approach to yield management by tokenizing future yield. Through the process of yield tokenization, Pendle allows users to separate the principal of a yield-bearing asset from the yield itself. This separation creates two distinct tokens: the Principal Token (PT), which represents the underlying asset, and the Yield Token (YT), which represents the future yield generated by the asset. 

These tokenized assets can then be traded, staked, or used in other DeFi strategies, providing users with more control over their yield. Pendle operates through an Automated Market Maker (AMM) system, which allows for the exchange of PT and YT tokens. This system introduces a new market for yield derivatives, making it possible for users to implement advanced yield strategies such as fixed yield, long yield positions, or maximizing yield without increasing exposure. 

Pendle has introduced a new mechanism in DeFi that makes yield more predictable and accessible. With a TVL of $5.4 billion, Pendle is establishing itself as a key player in the decentralized finance sector, offering users more flexibility in managing and earning from their assets.
